# pgnetdetective

A command line tool for converting pcap capture files (using tcpdump for example) into usable statistics about your PostgreSQL network traffic.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/procore/pgnetdetective
```

## Getting Started

Once you have installed pgnetdetective, you will want to get a pcap capture file to analyize.

This can be done using this command:
```
tcpdump -n -s 0 -w ~/pg.cap -i any port 5432
```

You will want to run the above command on the machine you are concerned with (whether it be client
or server).

If you want to try it out, feel free to use the [test app](https://github.com/procore/pgnetdetective/tree/master/test_app) within this repo. It requires a little
bit of setup, but is great for seeing how the stats work.

Once you have a pcap capture file, running pgnetdetective on it is as easy as:
```
pgnetdetective ~/pg.cap
```

### Example output (from [test_app](https://github.com/procore/pgnetdetective/tree/master/test_app))
